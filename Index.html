            <h2>Contactors vs Direct Labor</h2>
            <p>Generally this debate arises for people who have some knowledge of a build, such as an electrician, plumber or laborer. If you do not have any of these backgrounds, it is not recommended to go direct labor. Direct labor essentially means you will not need to pay a contractor to complete the build. However, it's important to rethink the benefits of a contractors job, as their job is highly underestimated. For example, contractors will have their own suppliers and understanding of the building stages and schedules. Various laborers will need to be scheduled throughout every stage of the build and when a part of the build is delayed, than this can delay the entire building process. A contractor will also be able to source their own materials and at cost rate (without VAT). As you draw down on your mortgage throughout every stage, you will be paying back the VAT to your contractor but getting items at cost rate is a massive help.</p>

            <p>You will need to acquire planning permission before you're able to apply for your mortgage. Ensure to speak to your engineer about local requirements, local needs, local aesthitic requirements, and any addition information required.
