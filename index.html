               <h2>This page will be taking you through your self build based on our recent building experience in 2019 (Dundalk, Ireland). Building your home can be daunting but it can be a wonderful experience with a bit of information and some helpful tools.</h2>

            <h2>Contactors vs Direct Labor</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Generally, the "Contractor vs Direct Labor" debate arises for people who have some knowledge of a build, such as an electrician, plumber or laborer. If you do not have any of these backgrounds, it is not recommended to go down the route of direct labor. Direct labor essentially means you will not need to pay a contractor to complete the build. However, it's important to rethink the benefits of a contractors job, as their job is highly underestimated. For example, contractors will have their own suppliers and understanding of the building stages and schedules. Various laborers will need to be scheduled throughout every stage of the build and when a part of the build is delayed, than this can delay the entire building process. A contractor will also be able to source their own materials and at cost rate (without VAT). As you draw down on your mortgage throughout every stage, you will be paying back the VAT to your contractor but getting items at cost rate is a massive help.</p>

            <h2>Mananaging Expectations</h2>
            <p>Often times, when we think of the style of our future home, we are influenced by social media, home network shows and celebrity homes. But it's important to manage your expectations throughout your build by having a budget in mind and only presenting the options that are available to you. Staying within your monetary range will open up plenty of options for you. In addition, you can often times find suppliers that have similar products. It is recommended to make a list of all of your additional costs, that a mortgage does not cover, such as kitchens, toilets, floors, and wardrobes. Then as you begin to get an understanding for the type of space and style, you can set a budget and begin planning with an excel sheet. Pinterest is a great tool to give you style ideas but ensure to manage your expecations on sites like these as well, as it's possible that certain styles or items are not within your reach. But don't panic! With a bit of searching and budgeting you will get the desire style effect for your home. Keep in mind that the building market for materials is ever changing. Due to Covid-19, prices of builds have increased but this is expected to drop in about a year. Giving you enough time to prepare for your first build.</p>

            <h2>Renting or Living at Home</h2>
            <p>Living at home can help you save money for your future build. Your self build is going to be quite cost consuming. Your mortage will only pay for basically the skeleton of your build; i.e. foundations, block-work, roof, plaster, windows, doors, plumbing, and electrics. Everything else (floors, kitchen, toilets, painting, outdoor finishings), will have to come out of your own budget. Living at your parent's home is the best way to save money during your build. You can often times pay your contractor in increments, allowing you to save and purchase during your build.</p>

            <h2>Second Chance Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Given another chance to build the same house, there are a couple of things I would do differently based on experience I picked up along the way. For one, I would change the style of toilet, shower and tap. Hidden taps is an aesthic that should be known prior to begining your plumbing works. Plumbing works begins after plastering is completed, so if hidden taps, shower head tap and toilets is a style you prefer, this should be communicated to your contractor and builder prior to commencing your build.</p>

            <h2>Mortgage</h2>
            <p>You will need to acquire planning permission before you're able to apply for your mortgage. Ensure to speak to your engineer about local requirements, local needs, local aesthitic requirements, and any addition information required. It is recommended to work with an engineer who has dealt with the local authority for planning permission.</p>
